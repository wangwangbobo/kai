"""
Per-chat concurrency primitives for serializing message handling.

Provides functionality to:
1. Allocate per-chat asyncio locks so only one message is processed at a time
2. Allocate per-chat stop events so /stop can interrupt in-flight responses
3. Bound memory usage by evicting the oldest entries when limits are reached

Both lock and stop-event pools are bounded dicts keyed by chat_id. The eviction
limit (_MAX_LOCKS) is generous for a single-user bot but prevents unbounded
growth if the bot were ever exposed to multiple chats.
