"""
Application entry point - initializes all subsystems and runs the Telegram bot.

Provides functionality to:
1. Configure logging with daily rotation and terminal output
2. Load configuration and validate environment
3. Initialize the database, Telegram bot, scheduled jobs, and webhook server
4. Restore workspace from previous session
5. Start the Telegram transport (webhook or polling, depending on config)
6. Notify the user if a previous response was interrupted by a crash
7. Run the event loop until shutdown (Ctrl+C or SIGTERM)
8. Clean up all resources in the correct order on exit

Telegram transport mode is determined by TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_URL in .env:
    - Set: webhook mode (Telegram POSTs updates to Kai's HTTP server)
    - Unset: polling mode (Kai pulls updates from Telegram's servers)

The startup sequence is:
    1. Load config from .env
    2. Initialize SQLite database
    3. Create the Telegram bot application (with or without Updater)
    4. Restore previous workspace (if saved in settings table)
    5. Initialize the Telegram bot and register slash commands
    6. Load scheduled jobs from database into APScheduler
    7. Start the webhook HTTP server (always runs for scheduling API, GitHub webhooks, etc.)
    8. In webhook mode: register Telegram webhook with the API
       In polling mode: start the Updater's polling loop
    9. Check for interrupted-response flag file
    10. Block forever on asyncio.Event().wait()

The shutdown sequence (in the finally block) reverses this order:
    webhook server -> polling updater (if active) -> bot -> Claude process -> Telegram app -> database
