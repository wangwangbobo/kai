"""
Application entry point — initializes all subsystems and runs the Telegram bot.

Provides functionality to:
1. Configure logging with daily rotation and terminal output
2. Load configuration and validate environment
3. Initialize the database, Telegram bot, scheduled jobs, and webhook server
4. Restore workspace from previous session
5. Notify the user if a previous response was interrupted by a crash
6. Run the event loop until shutdown (Ctrl+C or SIGTERM)
7. Clean up all resources in the correct order on exit

The startup sequence is:
    1. Load config from .env
    2. Initialize SQLite database
    3. Create the Telegram bot application
    4. Restore previous workspace (if saved in settings table)
    5. Start the Telegram updater (polling)
    6. Register slash commands in Telegram's menu
    7. Load scheduled jobs from database into APScheduler
    8. Start the webhook HTTP server
    9. Check for interrupted-response flag file
    10. Block forever on asyncio.Event().wait()

The shutdown sequence (in the finally block) reverses this order:
    webhook → updater → bot → Claude process → Telegram app → database
