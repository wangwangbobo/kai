"""
Conversation history logging and retrieval.

Provides functionality to:
1. Log every user and assistant message as JSONL (one file per day)
2. Retrieve recent messages for injection into new Claude sessions
3. Serve as the "episodic memory" layer of Kai's three-layer memory system

Log files are stored in workspace/.claude/history/ as date-stamped JSONL files
(e.g., 2026-02-11.jsonl). Each line is a JSON object with fields:
    ts       — ISO 8601 timestamp
    dir      — "user" or "assistant"
    chat_id  — Telegram chat ID
    text     — message text
    media    — optional dict with media metadata (type, filename, duration)

The inner Claude Code instance can search these files directly with grep or jq
when asked about past conversations. get_recent_history() provides a formatted
summary of the last few messages for ambient recall at session start.

    Return a formatted summary of recent messages, scanning back as needed.

    Scans date-stamped JSONL files from newest to oldest, collecting up to

    Injected into the first prompt of each new Claude session (in claude.py)

    full history. Long messages are truncated and the total count is capped.
