A personal AI assistant that lives in Telegram and runs entirely on your machine. Powered by [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) with full tool access - shell, filesystem, web search - and a security model designed around the fact that it has all of that.

For detailed guides on setup, architecture, and optional features, see the **[Wiki](https://github.com/dcellison/kai/wiki)**.

## Why local?

Kai bridges Telegram and a persistent Claude Code process running on your hardware. Messages go in, streaming responses come back, and Claude has real access to your system. That power is the point - and it's why the security model is non-negotiable.

Everything runs locally. Conversations never transit a relay server. Voice transcription and synthesis happen on-device. API keys are proxied through an internal service layer so they never appear in conversation context. There is no cloud component between you and your machine.

## Security model

Giving an AI agent shell access is a real trust decision. Kai's approach is layered defense - each layer independent, so no single failure is catastrophic:

- **Telegram auth** - only explicitly whitelisted user IDs can interact. Unauthorized messages are silently dropped before reaching any handler.
- **TOTP gate** (optional) - two-factor authentication via time-based one-time passwords. After a configurable idle timeout, Kai requires a 6-digit authenticator code before processing anything. The secret lives in a root-owned file (mode 0600) that the bot process cannot read directly; it verifies codes through narrowly-scoped sudoers rules. Even if someone compromises your Telegram account, they can't use your assistant without your authenticator device. Rate limiting with disk-persisted lockout protects against brute force.
- **Process isolation** - authentication state lives in the bot's in-memory context, not in the filesystem or conversation history. The inner Claude process cannot read, manipulate, or bypass the auth gate.
- **Path confinement** - file exchange operations are restricted to the active workspace via `Path.relative_to()`. Traversal attempts are rejected.
- **Service proxy** - external API keys live in server-side config (`services.yaml`) and are injected at request time. Claude calls APIs through a local proxy endpoint; the keys never enter the conversation.

Setup for TOTP requires the optional dependency group and root access:

```bash
pip install -e '.[totp]'             # adds pyotp and qrcode
sudo python -m kai totp setup        # generate secret, display QR code, confirm
```

## Features

### Streaming responses

Responses stream into Telegram in real time, updating the message every 2 seconds.

### Model switching

Switch between Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku via `/models` (interactive picker) or `/model <name>` (direct). Changing models restarts the session.

### Workspaces

Point Claude at any project with `/workspace <name>`. Names resolve relative to `WORKSPACE_BASE` (set in `.env`). Identity and memory from the home workspace carry over. Create new workspaces with `/workspace new <name>`. Absolute paths are not accepted - all workspaces must live under the configured base directory.

### File exchange

Send any file type directly in chat -- photos, documents, PDFs, archives, anything. Files are saved to `workspace/files/` with timestamped names, and Claude gets the path so it can work with them via shell tools. Claude can also send files back to you through the internal API. Images render inline; everything else arrives as a document attachment.

### Voice input

Voice notes are transcribed locally using [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp) and forwarded to Claude. Requires `ffmpeg` and `whisper-cpp`. Disabled by default - set `VOICE_ENABLED=true` after installing dependencies. See the [Voice Setup](https://github.com/dcellison/kai/wiki/Voice-Setup) wiki page.

### Voice responses (TTS)

Text-to-speech via [Piper TTS](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper). Three modes: `/voice only` (voice note, no text), `/voice on` (text + voice), `/voice off` (text only, default). Eight curated English voices. Requires `pip install -e '.[tts]'` and `TTS_ENABLED=true`. See [Voice Setup](https://github.com/dcellison/kai/wiki/Voice-Setup).

### Dual-mode Telegram transport

Kai supports two ways of receiving Telegram updates: **long polling** (default) and **webhooks**. Polling works out of the box behind NAT with zero infrastructure. Set `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_URL` in `.env` to switch to webhook mode for lower latency - this requires a tunnel or reverse proxy (see [Exposing Kai to the Internet](https://github.com/dcellison/kai/wiki/Exposing-Kai-to-the-Internet)).

### Webhooks

An HTTP server receives GitHub webhook events (pushes, PRs, issues, comments, reviews) and forwards them to Telegram. Signatures are validated via HMAC-SHA256. A generic webhook endpoint (`POST /webhook`) accepts JSON from any service. See [Exposing Kai to the Internet](https://github.com/dcellison/kai/wiki/Exposing-Kai-to-the-Internet).

### Scheduled jobs

Reminders and recurring Claude jobs with one-shot, daily, and interval schedules. Ask naturally ("remind me at 3pm") or use the HTTP API (`POST /api/schedule`). Claude jobs support conditional auto-remove for monitoring use cases (`CONDITION_MET` / `CONDITION_NOT_MET` protocol). See [Scheduling and Conditional Jobs](https://github.com/dcellison/kai/wiki/Scheduling-and-Conditional-Jobs).

### Memory

Three layers of persistent context:

1. **Auto-memory** - managed by Claude Code per-workspace. Project architecture and patterns.
2. **Home memory** (`workspace/.claude/MEMORY.md`) - personal memory, always injected regardless of current workspace. Proactively updated by Kai.
3. **Conversation history** (`workspace/.claude/history/`) - JSONL logs, one file per day. Searchable for past conversations.

Foreign workspaces also get their own `.claude/MEMORY.md` injected alongside home memory. See [System Architecture](https://github.com/dcellison/kai/wiki/System-Architecture).

### Crash recovery

If interrupted mid-response, Kai notifies you on restart and asks you to resend your last message.

## Requirements

- Python 3.13+
- [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed and authenticated
- A Telegram bot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
- Your Telegram user ID (get it from [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot))

## Setup

```bash
git clone git@github.com:dcellison/kai.git
cd kai
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e '.[dev]'
cp .env.example .env
```

### Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | Yes | | Bot token from BotFather |
| `ALLOWED_USER_IDS` | Yes | | Comma-separated Telegram user IDs |
| `CLAUDE_MODEL` | No | `sonnet` | Default model (`opus`, `sonnet`, or `haiku`) |
| `CLAUDE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | No | `120` | Per-message timeout |
| `CLAUDE_MAX_BUDGET_USD` | No | `10.0` | Session budget cap |
| `WORKSPACE_BASE` | No | | Base directory for workspace name resolution |
| `WEBHOOK_PORT` | No | `8080` | HTTP server port for webhooks and scheduling API |
| `WEBHOOK_SECRET` | No | | Secret for webhook validation and scheduling API auth |
| `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_URL` | No | | Telegram webhook URL (enables webhook mode; omit for polling) |
| `TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | No | | Separate secret for Telegram webhook auth (defaults to `WEBHOOK_SECRET`) |
| `VOICE_ENABLED` | No | `false` | Enable voice message transcription |
| `TTS_ENABLED` | No | `false` | Enable text-to-speech voice responses |
| `TOTP_SESSION_MINUTES` | No | `30` | Minutes before TOTP re-authentication is required |
| `TOTP_CHALLENGE_SECONDS` | No | `120` | Seconds the code entry window stays open |
| `TOTP_LOCKOUT_ATTEMPTS` | No | `3` | Failed TOTP attempts before temporary lockout |
| `TOTP_LOCKOUT_MINUTES` | No | `15` | TOTP lockout duration in minutes |

`CLAUDE_MAX_BUDGET_USD` limits how much work Claude can do in a single session via Claude Code's `--max-budget-usd` flag. On Pro/Max plans this is purely a runaway prevention mechanism (no per-token charges). The session resets on `/new`, model switch, or workspace switch.

## Running

```bash
make run
```

Or manually: `source .venv/bin/activate && python -m kai`

### Running as a service (macOS)

Create `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.kai.bot.plist`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.kai.bot</string>

    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
        <string>/path/to/kai/.venv/bin/python</string>
        <string>-m</string>
        <string>kai</string>
    </array>

    <key>WorkingDirectory</key>
    <string>/path/to/kai</string>

    <key>EnvironmentVariables</key>
    <dict>
        <key>PATH</key>
        <string>/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin</string>
    </dict>

    <key>RunAtLoad</key>
    <true/>

    <key>KeepAlive</key>
    <dict>
        <key>NetworkState</key>
        <true/>
    </dict>

    <key>ProcessType</key>
    <string>Background</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Replace `/path/to/kai` with your actual project path. The `PATH` must include directories for `claude`, `ffmpeg`, and any other tools Kai shells out to.

The `NetworkState` condition ensures launchd waits for network availability before starting Kai, preventing DNS failures during boot when the network isn't ready yet.

```bash
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.kai.bot.plist
```

Kai will start immediately and restart automatically on login or crash. Logs go to `logs/kai.log` with daily rotation (14 days of history). To stop:

```bash
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.kai.bot.plist
```

### Running as a service (Linux)

Create `/etc/systemd/system/kai.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Kai Telegram Bot
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=YOUR_USERNAME
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/kai
ExecStart=/path/to/kai/.venv/bin/python -m kai
Restart=always
RestartSec=5
Environment=PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `/path/to/kai` with your values. Add any extra directories to `PATH` where `claude`, `ffmpeg`, etc. are installed.

The `network-online.target` dependency ensures systemd waits for network connectivity before starting Kai, preventing DNS failures during boot.

```bash
sudo systemctl enable kai
sudo systemctl start kai
```

Check logs with `tail -f logs/kai.log` or `journalctl -u kai -f`. To stop:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop kai
```
