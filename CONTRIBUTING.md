# Contributing to Kai

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Kai. This document covers
how the project accepts contributions and what to expect.

## How to Contribute

**Pull requests are currently restricted to collaborators.** Kai's
architecture is evolving quickly and all implementation is handled
internally to keep the codebase coherent. This will open up as the
project stabilizes - check back or watch the repo for updates.

**The best way to contribute right now is through issues.** Bug reports,
feature ideas, and design feedback are all welcome. For non-trivial
proposals, describe the problem, your proposed solution, what changes
you think are needed, and what's explicitly out of scope. A clear
write-up is more valuable than a surprise PR - it lets us discuss the
approach before anyone writes code.

**Open an issue first.** Even if you're a collaborator, open an issue
before starting work on anything non-trivial. This keeps the "why"
(issue) separate from the "how" (PR) and gives the triage agent
something to work with.

## Development Setup

If you want to run Kai locally (for testing, exploring, or preparing a
future contribution):

```bash
# Clone and install in a virtual environment
git clone git@github.com:dcellison/kai.git
cd kai
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e '.[dev]'

# Verify everything works
make check    # ruff lint + format check
make test     # pytest
```

Requires **Python 3.13+**. See the
[Getting Started](https://github.com/dcellison/kai/wiki/Getting-Started)
wiki page for full setup instructions including `.env` configuration.

## Branch and PR Workflow (Collaborators)

This section is for project collaborators with push access. If you're
contributing through issues, you can skip this - but the standards below
are useful context for writing proposals.

Direct pushes to `main` are blocked. All changes go through pull
requests with required CI checks.

1. **Create a branch** from `main` with a descriptive prefix:
   - `feature/` -- new functionality
   - `fix/` -- bug fixes
   - `docs/` -- documentation only
   - `refactor/` -- restructuring without behavior change
   - `chore/` -- dependency updates, CI changes, etc.
   - `test/` -- test additions or fixes

   Use kebab-case for the rest: `feature/file-exchange`, `fix/path-traversal`.

2. **Keep PRs focused.** One feature or fix per PR. If you notice
   something else worth fixing, open a separate issue.

3. **Review your own diff before submitting.** Every file in the diff
   should be there intentionally. Unrelated deletions, reformatting of
   untouched code, or tooling artifacts (`.idea/`, `.vscode/`, etc.)
   will get the PR sent back.

4. **CI must pass.** The pipeline runs ruff (lint + format) and pytest.
   Check locally first:
   ```bash
   make check && make test
   ```

5. **Expect an automated review.** Kai runs a PR Review Agent that
   posts a code review comment on every push. It checks for bugs,
   security issues, missing error handling, and style violations. If
   you reference a spec file (add `spec: path/to/spec.md` in the PR
   body), it also checks your implementation against the spec. Treat
   its feedback like any other review - address what's valid, explain
   what's intentional.

## Project Standards

The following sections describe the standards the codebase follows.
These apply to all code changes and are useful context for anyone
proposing features or reviewing the architecture.

### Code Style

- **Ruff** handles linting and formatting. The full rule configuration
  is in `pyproject.toml`.
- **Line length:** 120 characters max.
- **Imports:** sorted by ruff's isort rules (stdlib, third-party,
  first-party).

### Comments and Docstrings

The codebase is thoroughly commented. All code changes are expected to
match this standard:

- **Every function and class** gets a docstring. Single-line for simple
  helpers, multi-line with `Args:` / `Returns:` for anything non-trivial.
- **Module docstrings** explain the module's purpose and responsibilities.
- **Inline comments** explain *why*, not *what*. Focus on non-obvious logic,
  edge cases, and workarounds.
- **Section separators** divide logical groups within a module:
  ```python
  # -- Authorization --------------------------------------------------------
  ```

Example of the expected style:

```python
async def save_session(chat_id: int, session_id: str, model: str, cost_usd: float) -> None:
    """
    Save or update a Claude session for a chat.

    On conflict (existing chat_id), the session_id and model are updated,
    last_used_at is refreshed, and total_cost_usd is accumulated (not replaced).

    Args:
        chat_id: Telegram chat ID.
        session_id: Claude session identifier from the stream-json response.
        model: Model name used for this session (e.g., "sonnet").
        cost_usd: Cost of this particular interaction (added to running total).
    """
```

### Type Safety

The codebase passes Pyright in strict mode. All code changes are
expected to maintain this:

- Type annotations on all function signatures.
- `assert` for narrowing `Optional` types from external libraries.
- Extract `@property` returns to local variables before narrowing
  (Pyright limitation).

### Security

Kai exposes a webhook server and API endpoints. Changes that touch
networking, file I/O, or process execution follow these rules:

- **Path confinement:** `Path.relative_to()` for directory containment
  checks, not string prefix matching (which is bypassable via symlinks).
- **Input validation:** Validate at system boundaries (user input, API
  payloads, external data). Nothing from the network is trusted.
- **No new attack surface without discussion.** New endpoints, file
  operations, or shell commands get discussed in an issue first.

### Tests

- Tests live in `tests/` and use **pytest** with **pytest-asyncio**.
- New features need tests. Bug fixes include a regression test where
  practical.
- Test the function directly when possible (unit tests over integration
  tests). Mock external dependencies (Telegram API, filesystem for
  destructive operations).

Run the full suite with:
```bash
make test
```

## What Not to Include

These should never appear in a pull request:

- **Secrets or credentials** -- `.env` files, API keys, tokens. The
  `.gitignore` already covers these, but always verify before pushing.
- **Generated files** -- IDE configs, OS metadata (`.DS_Store`), build
  artifacts, tool caches.
- **Unrelated changes** -- reformatting files that weren't otherwise
  modified, deleting files outside the scope of the work, adding ignore
  rules for personal tooling.
